data: contains the raw datasets found from Daron Acemoglu's website.

ace_xr.R: Contains the code to clean the cross-region data from Acemoglu et al. (2014). Also includes a few attempts at finding a corresponding two-stage least squares regression to the paper.
ace_xc.R: Contains the code to clean the cross-country data from Acemoglu et al. (2014). Also generated two scatterplots demonstrating the general effects of the paper described. The images are also in the repository. Regression estimates also found.

hkiv.png: This image shows the relationship between human capital and GDP as described in the paper. The correlation seems very weak, leading to the belief that human capital endowments do not have a very large effect on present economic performance.
institutioneffect.png: This image is another scatterplot similar to hkiv.png. The only difference is instead of human capital endowments it demonstrates the rule of law, the measurement used for institutuions.

outline.pdf: contains the main extension paper discussing the research design and my extensions. Please read.
